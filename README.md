# Weather-App
This is a weather status application that I created using Bulma CSS Framework, HTML coding language, and JavaScript. Note that although I created this application, all the information that is used within it is extracted from an API managed by OpenWeather. 

# Project Description
This project is a representatino of what I learned so far with doing fetchRequests and also builds upon my prior knowledge of knowing how to use CSS Frameworks and Day.js. Using the ReadME for Challenge 6, I created this project to perform the following functions:

Created two html documents, one for the homepage and one for the application itself. The homepage html doc, index.html, communicates with the results html doc, search.html, by allowing a user to input the name of a city or county from any country across the globe to see its current weather status and 5 day forecast. Once a name is entered and the user clicks on the 'See Forecast' button, the script.js file takes that user input and uses it to open up the search.html doc to display the results of the user's input. Once search.html doc is opened, the results.js file takes the search parameters and begins compiling data from the OpenWeather API and displays it on designated sections on the html document for users to see that information. Also, added in capability to save user inputs into local storage and users can select previous search results by clicking on the buttons in the Previous Searches section. Aside from weather conditions, information such as the date, wind speed, temperature, and humidity are also displayed.
